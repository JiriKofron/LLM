# BPE Example Documentation

## Overview
This script demonstrates Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE), a subword tokenization method used by models like GPT-2. It shows how BPE breaks down words into subword units and handles unknown words.

## Key Concepts

### BPE Process
- How BPE merges characters
- How subword units are created
- How vocabulary is built
- How unknown words are handled

### BPE Advantages
- Handles unknown words
- Reduces vocabulary size
- Preserves word structure
- Efficient for many languages

### BPE Analysis
- How to analyze BPE results
- How to understand merges
- How to handle special cases
- How to evaluate effectiveness

## Usage
```python
python scripts/bpe_example.py
```

## Output
The script will show:
1. BPE tokenization process
2. Subword unit creation
3. Vocabulary building
4. Unknown word handling
5. Key points about BPE
