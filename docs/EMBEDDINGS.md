# Understanding Word Embeddings

## What are Embeddings?

Embeddings are a way to represent words as vectors (lists of numbers) in a way that captures their meaning and relationships.

### Basic Concept
- Words are converted into numbers
- These numbers capture semantic meaning
- Similar words have similar numbers
- The numbers can be used for mathematical operations

## Types of Embeddings

### 1. Static Embeddings
- Same word always gets the same numbers
- Examples: Word2Vec, GloVe
- Advantages:
  - Simple to understand
  - Fast to compute
  - Good for basic tasks
- Limitations:
  - Can't handle multiple meanings
  - Same word always has same representation

### 2. Contextual Embeddings
- Same word can get different numbers based on context
- Examples: BERT, GPT
- Advantages:
  - Can handle multiple meanings
  - Better understanding of context
  - More accurate for complex tasks
- Limitations:
  - More complex
  - Slower to compute
  - Requires more resources

## How Embeddings Work

### 1. Static Embeddings (Word2Vec)
- Train on large text corpus
- Learn relationships between words
- Create fixed vectors for each word
- Example:
  ```
  king - man + woman = queen
  ```
  This works because the relationships are captured in the numbers

### 2. Contextual Embeddings (BERT)
- Consider the entire sentence
- Generate different vectors for same word
- Example:
  ```
  "bank" in "river bank" vs "bank account"
  ```
  Gets different numbers based on context

## Why Embeddings Matter

### 1. For Language Models
- Help understand word meaning
- Capture relationships between words
- Enable mathematical operations on words
- Improve model performance

### 2. For Applications
- Better text understanding
- More accurate translations
- Improved search results
- Better text generation

## Common Questions

### 1. Why do we need embeddings?
- Computers can't understand words directly
- Numbers are easier to process
- Embeddings capture meaning in numbers
- Enable mathematical operations on words

### 2. How many numbers are in an embedding?
- Word2Vec: typically 100-300 numbers
- BERT: 768 numbers
- GPT: 768-4096 numbers
- More numbers = more capacity to capture meaning

### 3. Can we visualize embeddings?
- Yes, using dimensionality reduction
- Similar words cluster together
- Can see relationships between words
- Helps understand how models "see" words

## Practical Applications

### 1. Text Analysis
- Sentiment analysis
- Topic modeling
- Document clustering
- Similarity search

### 2. Natural Language Processing
- Machine translation
- Question answering
- Text generation
- Named entity recognition
