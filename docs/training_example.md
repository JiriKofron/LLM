# Training Example Documentation

## Overview
This script demonstrates how training affects embeddings and relationships between words. It shows how the model learns to adjust embeddings based on examples and context.

## Key Concepts

### Training Process
- How embeddings are adjusted
- How relationships are learned
- How context influences learning
- How patterns emerge

### Learning Effects
- Changes in embedding values
- Changes in word relationships
- Changes in context understanding
- Changes in semantic meaning

### Training Analysis
- How to observe training effects
- How to measure changes
- How to understand learning
- How to evaluate results

## Usage
```python
python scripts/training_example.py
```

## Output
The script will show:
1. Initial embeddings
2. Training process
3. Changes in relationships
4. Learning effects
5. Key points about training
