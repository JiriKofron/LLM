# Token Embedding Relationship Documentation

## Overview
This script demonstrates the relationship between tokens and their embeddings, showing how each token maps to a specific embedding vector and how these embeddings capture meaning.

## Key Concepts

### Token to Embedding Mapping
- Each token has a unique ID
- Each token ID maps to an embedding
- Embeddings are learned during training
- The mapping is consistent across uses

### Embedding Properties
- Embeddings are fixed-size vectors
- Values are learned from context
- Similar tokens have similar embeddings
- Embeddings capture semantic meaning

### Relationship Analysis
- How tokens map to embeddings
- How embeddings represent meaning
- How similar tokens relate
- How context affects embeddings

## Usage
```python
python scripts/token_embedding_relationship.py
```

## Output
The script will show:
1. Token to embedding mapping
2. Embedding properties
3. Similar token relationships
4. Context effects on embeddings
5. Key points about relationships
