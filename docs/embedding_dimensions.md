# Embedding Dimensions Documentation

## Overview
This script demonstrates how dimensions in embeddings work together to capture different aspects of meaning. It shows how multiple dimensions are needed to represent the complexity of language.

## Key Concepts

### Dimensions
- Each dimension captures different features
- Multiple dimensions work together
- Dimensions are learned during training
- No single dimension has a fixed meaning

### Dimension Interaction
- How dimensions complement each other
- How dimensions capture relationships
- How dimensions handle ambiguity
- How dimensions represent context

### Dimension Analysis
- How to analyze dimension patterns
- How dimensions contribute to meaning
- How dimensions handle different words
- How dimensions capture relationships

## Usage
```python
python scripts/embedding_dimensions.py
```

## Output
The script will show:
1. How dimensions work together
2. Dimension patterns in words
3. How dimensions capture meaning
4. Dimension relationships
5. Key points about dimensions
