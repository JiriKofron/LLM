# Training Relationships Documentation

## Overview
This script demonstrates how training influences the model's understanding of relationships between words, showing how the model can learn to emphasize certain relationships over others based on its training data.

## Key Concepts

### Training Influence
- Training can change how the model sees relationships
- More examples of a word in a particular context will strengthen those relationships
- The model learns to adjust its embeddings based on usage patterns
- Relationships are not fixed but can be modified through training

### Context Learning
- The model learns from examples of word usage
- It adjusts embeddings to better capture common relationships
- It can learn to emphasize certain meanings over others
- The learning process is continuous and data-driven

### Relationship Changes
- Initial relationships can be modified through training
- The model can learn to emphasize certain relationships
- It can learn to de-emphasize other relationships
- These changes are based on patterns in the training data

## Usage
```python
python training_relationships.py
```

## Output
The script will show:
1. Initial relationships between words
2. How training would influence these relationships
3. Examples of relationship changes
4. How the model learns from examples
5. Key points about training influence
