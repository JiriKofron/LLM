# Dimension Meaning Documentation

## Overview
This script demonstrates how dimensions work together to capture meaning in language models, showing that dimensions don't have predefined meanings but rather learn to capture relationships between words.

## Key Concepts

### Dimensions
- Each dimension is just a number
- Dimensions don't have predefined meanings
- The model learns what these numbers mean
- Meaning emerges from how dimensions work together

### Pattern Recognition
- Similar words have similar patterns across dimensions
- These patterns emerge from how words are used together
- The model learns these patterns during training
- No single dimension captures a complete concept

### Relationship Types
- Some dimensions capture gender relationships
- Others capture size relationships
- Others capture emotional relationships
- The model learns to use dimensions to capture these relationships

## Usage
```python
python dimension_meaning.py
```

## Output
The script will show:
1. How dimensions don't have predefined meanings
2. How similar words have similar patterns
3. How dimensions work together
4. An example with the word "king"
5. Key points about dimension meaning
